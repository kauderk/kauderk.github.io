## I use it to describe scramble scene ideas that pop into my head, that are too complex to express with words, drawings, or even my own animations.

## I use it to recall little, almost insignificant details at first glance. When I stumble onto invaluable content, especially in video form.

## I use it to remember time and time again those sick, cool, memorable, astonishing, touching beats in songs.
