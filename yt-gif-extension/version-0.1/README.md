# **YT GIF an extension for Roam Research**

# What problems does it solve?
Learning a new skill, practicing/mastering something or simply enjoying your favorite content. Things that you know you'll have to see over and over. Now you don't even need to click elements; hovering to play/hear videos is a game changer. You will feel spoiled. Basically, you'll save tons of time.

# What does it do?
Loops videos between the `start` and `end` YouTube URL parameters.
`{{[[yt-gif]]: https://youtu.be/46A01oukux0?t=20&end=100 }}` Simple as that, create as many "**YouTube Gifs**" and begin to visualize some ideas.

"I'm using it to practice a new language." "It's perfect for my classes." "I'll use it to take notes on movies." 
Those are some of the things people have said. I'm curious, how are you using it?
