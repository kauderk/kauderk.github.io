1. Google > Stylus Extension
2. Click on it's icon > manage
3. Backups tab > import
4. From here > https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kauderk/kauderk.github.io/main/yt-gif-extension/css/Beautiful%20YT%20iframe%20controls/stylus-2021-10-03-yt-gif.json
5. right click > SAVE AS (.json)
6. "Pop up menu saying, 'Finished import styles" > options > import
