### Can't they be like `{{[[video]]}}` components and it's features?
- I believe Roam Research does not expose their components; thus YT GIFs have to be their own separate extension, and for that matter they work exclusively with Youtube videos.


---
### What are "InAndOutKeys"?
Whenever you exit a frame/iframe/player/playbox/YTGIF hold down either Alt - Ctrl - Shift or the Middle Mouse Button to unmute and or keep playing the video.
They can vary depending on the `Play Style` or `Sound Style` you choose.


---
### Timestamps
- `{{[[video]]}}` and `{{[[yt-gif]]}}` components will use their own timestamps. They do not share logic, nor functionality.

#### The capture shortcuts don't work
- I'm afraid it's a Javascript cross Browser compatibility issue.
#### The capture smartblocks don't work
- There are `Smartblocks` and `SmartblocksV2`, the YT GIF extension uses the latest version of Smartblocks.


---
### Why is the playbox is so small? Can the playbox of GIf be resized?
- Append `&sp=100` [url parameter](https://github.com/kauderk/kauderk.github.io/tree/main/yt-gif-extension/install/faq#what-are-url-parameters-how-do-i-use-them) to the youtube video url within a YTGIF you should be able to override the playbox/player span.
If this doesn't work, most likely you're using a custom css rules that conflicts with the YT GIF extension; downwards the `rm-block__input` element.


---
### What is the difference between [[video]] and [[yt-gif]]?
- `{{[[video]]}}` is a native component by Roam Research that supports multiple video types, and `{{[[yt-gif]]}}` is a component made by me that supports only Youtube videos (urls).


---
### What does "Iframe/Player Buffer" do?
- The nature of Roam Research makes it so you can open multiple pages with multiple blocks within them; YT GIFs, ultimately iframes, are way too expensive to have them loaded in the background all the time. The solution is to use a buffer; those oldest ones will be unloaded and ready to be played once you interact with them.


---
### How do I change the volume?
- Append `&vl=50` [url parameter](https://github.com/kauderk/kauderk.github.io/tree/main/yt-gif-extension/install/faq#what-are-url-parameters-how-do-i-use-them) to the youtube video url within a YTGIF. Keep in mind this is a custom parameter, and it's not supported by YouTube.


---
### Can I set a custom playback speed?
- Append `&s=2` [url parameter](https://github.com/kauderk/kauderk.github.io/tree/main/yt-gif-extension/install/faq#what-are-url-parameters-how-do-i-use-them) to the youtube video url within a YTGIF. Keep in mind this is a custom parameter, and it's not supported by YouTube.


---
### Does it support multiple languages?
- Only the video player interface does. You will find more information within your own graph: `player_captions_on_load `, `player_captions_language` and `player_interface_language`.


---
### What is a "Timestamp Display"?
Because the main feature of the YT GIF extension is to use timestamps as boundaries, you might be interested to see the duration of a small section, or the position relative to the entire video.


---
### What is "roam/js/kauderk/yt-gif/settings" really doing in my graph?
- The main and only purpose of this file is to store settings for the extension. Because Roam Research can be accesed from any device with a browser, it's wiser to store users data within their own graphs. Now, so far it stores numeric values, on and off switches, and strings.
It is a [javascript file](https://github.com/kauderk/kauderk.github.io/blob/main/yt-gif-extension/v0.2.0/testing/js/settings-page.js) that uses the `Roam Alpha API` to read and write the settings in the form of blocks, with the following structure: 
    -  `(xxxuidxxx)` : `yt_gif_settings_key` : `<value>`
    
### I change the `<values>` but nothing happens
Any manual change done to `"roam/js/kauderk/yt-gif/settings"` block's values will be reflected **once you reload your graph** (with the extension running).

---
### What are the URL parameters? How do I use them?
- Well, it depends, the way url parameters work:
In this case, youtube video urls, `https://youtu.be/videoID?` notice the `?` question mark, the first parameter will be anything supported, like `t=` start and `end=` etc.
But after any of them you'd like to use - **every single one must be chained** with a `&` before the actual parameter, like `&t=` start or `&end` end.
Now, most YTGIFs users are used to `https://youtu.be/videoID?t=0&end=100` for example. Starting form there, YT GIF supports additional parameters like `&s=` speed, ` &vl=` volume and [more...](https://github.com/kauderk/kauderk.github.io/tree/main/yt-gif-extension/install#:~:text=Customize%20each%20YT%20GIF%2C%20even%20multiple%20ones%20within%20the%20same%20block)



---
### What is "Simulate inline url button to video component"? How they different themselves form Roam Reserach's?
Currently, Roam Research's video buttons will format every single link; they will not respect current components `{{[[video]]}}` or any other.
YT GIF's Url Buttons will try to find the one the user requested (clicked on). But I shall warn everybody who's reading this, it is using the function `window.roamAlphaAPI.updateBlock` to perform the changes (formatting), which means: that block on which you clicked on **will be updated after it passes my standards**. If Roam Research where to change: `css classes`, `uid's structure`, the `updateBlock` function itself, etc. People might lose information related to that particular block.



---
### Embracing `{{[[embed]]}}` and `((xxxuidxxx))` block references
YT GIFs, YT GIFs Timestamps & YT GIF Url Buttons will be rendered along with Roam Research's nesting block system. I encourage people to not hold back form exploding this `feature`; after all, it is what Roam Research users find more exciting about the software.

### Limitations
- They will **sometimes** not work with **expanded** `{{=:|}}` tooltip cards. Why? [Because I can't find a way to retrieve their `uid` of origin.](https://roamresearch.slack.com/archives/CTAE9JC2K/p1638578496037700)
